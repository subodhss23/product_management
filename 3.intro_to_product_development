4. Getting deeper into the product development process
    - product development process
    
    - Company
        - Conceive, plan, develop, iterate, launch, steady state, maintain or kill

    a. Conceive
        - collect user problem, brain storm solutions, 
        - identify focus areas
        - biggest source of idea comes from inside of company from the employees of the company themselves
    
    b. Plan
        - doing market research, research on the above ideas,
        - build business case for montization,
        - customer interview and see if people find the idea is really a problem
        - roadmap of what we can make, how long will it take, and what point we should have particular feature
        
    c. Develop
        - timelines, write features, specks, user stories,
        - discuss with engineering estimation of time taken to develop,
        - before development requirement should be set and should not be changed before validation of MVP
    
    d. Iterate
        - finish MVP or prototype
        - early feedback from users,
        - keep testing with alpha, beta, 

    e. Launch
        - work with marketing, legal, PR, sales,
        - send out to public

    f. Steady state 
        - collecting metrics(heavy), how people are using it, 
        - analyse, optimize with metrics, maximum return for investment,
        - heavy marketing and sales,
        - asses on how likely are we moving further with this product

    g. Maintain or kill
        - descision should be made with data
        - how frequent people are buying, using it, are we competative in market with this product,
        - how much money are we spending to maintain it vs money we are generating
        - might not fit company vision anymore
       
        - If decided to kill
            - sunsetting a product
            - end of life plan
            - let customer know so that they can back up data or find alternatives

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - just about building something intelligently without using the resource until needed.
