A practical template for product thinking


User  ->   Market   ->  Solution    ->  Build

    - user -> who are the users and what are their needs, wants?
    - market -> how are the use cases being met today?
    - solution -> what solution can we build that will address the gap?
    - build -> build the solution.


Team -> are we the right team?
Measure -> How will we know if we are succeeding?
Research -> Are the external factor favorable?
Iteration -> Are we adapting at every step?
