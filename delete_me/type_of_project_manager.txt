First of all it was great to know about the type of product manager. Even though all three project managers play a vital role in a company cause they are eventually 
building the product. I would love to be an internal product manager who would be build tools for internal teams. The reason being that the number of users wouldn't 
be as high as consumer product. There is a very high risk of encourtering major obstacles in every steps. Specially without having any hands on industry experience.

It would be a great way to learn by being a internal project manager. The risk and pessure would also be minimized to some extent. But the feedback would be coming 
from experts, professional who have been working in industry. They would know what, where, and why which might make the job little bit easier.
